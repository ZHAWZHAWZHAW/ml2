# News Summarizer for PDFs and URLs
## 1) Project Goal and Motivation

In an era where information overload is a significant challenge, individuals and professionals alike struggle to keep up with the vast amounts of news published daily. The problem is not the lack of information but rather the overwhelming abundance of it, making it difficult to stay informed efficiently. This project aims to solve the problem of information overload by providing a tool that can summarize news articles from PDFs and URLs quickly and accurately.

### Motivation

The motivation behind this project stems from the need for an efficient way to digest news. In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, people need to stay updated without spending excessive time reading through long articles. Whether it's a busy professional who needs to catch up on the latest industry news, a student researching current events, or a casual reader wanting to stay informed, everyone benefits from concise, accurate summaries.
